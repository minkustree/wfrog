    '''
    Station driver for Fine Offset WH1080, WH1081, WH1090, WH1091, WH2080, WH2081.
    This also covers all the re-branded weather stations working with EasyWeather:
      - Elecsa AstroTouch 6975
      - Watson W-8681
      - WH-1080PC
      - Scientific Sales Pro Touch Screen Weather Station
      - TOPCOM NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 265NE
      - PCE-FWS 20

    This driver is a wrapper around pywws, thus
    needs this package installed on your system.
